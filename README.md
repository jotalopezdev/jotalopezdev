# 👋 Hey there! I'm Jota

I'm a Systems Engineer passionate about building solid, well-typed solutions. I like to go beyond the *"what it does"* and dive deep into the *"how it works."* While my background has always leaned toward backend, Flutter managed to win me over.

## 🧠 About Me

* 🎓 Systems Engineer
* 🔧 Technical background focused on backend and architecture
* 💙 Strongly-typed language enthusiast
* 📱 Currently diving deep into Flutter and its ecosystem
* 🫡 (Fun fact: I did military service — turns out, discipline applies to code too 😅)

## 🚀 What you'll find in this GitHub:

* Personal projects built with Flutter and Dart
* Technical experiments and lessons learned along the way
* Architectures I try to keep clean and maintainable
* Things I create for fun, not just for work

## 🌱 Always learning about:

* Best practices in Flutter
* Code organization and scalability in mobile apps
* Low-level things like FFI (when needed)
* Automation and CI/CD for mobile development
